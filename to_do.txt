1. homePath should be consistent accross all the systems; while installing the application, ask the user about the installation directory so that you can use installation directory in - crontab, crontab's shellScript, creating alreadyWarned.txt etc

2. Provide the user an option to customize the threshold - 10 to 97

3. The warning message should be styled by increasing the font size of 1st line, 41% in 2nd line; also try changing the font color, style etc
