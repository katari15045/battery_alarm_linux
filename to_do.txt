1. homePath should be consistent accross all the systems; while installing the application, ask the user about the installation directory so that you can use installation directory in - crontab, crontab's shellScript, creating alreadyWarned.txt etc

2. Provide the user an option to customize the threshold - 10 to 97

3. The warning message should be styled by increasing the font size of 1st line, 41% in 2nd line; also try changing the font color, style etc

4. Before appending a line in the crontab, check if the line that you are going to append is already present

5. During installation, make sure that all the files (.class, .sh) are at the homePath by -
	(i) a DirectoryChooser to choose downloaded directory
	(ii) a shell script to copy all the files from the downloaded directory to homePath
6. Programatically fill job.sh just before cronAppend
